                    This tool is like a link redirect detective that will follow your URLs and help you diagnose complex linking problems. As you migrate your website or rename URLs on your website, you need to forward that old URL address to a new URL address. It is best to test your URLs to ensure they go to the correct places and do not encounter an <a href="">error 404</a> along the way. Keep in mind, if you end up creating redirect chains, any error encountered during the redirect process could prevent the user from reaching the final destination.

                <h2 class="main-header">SEO Redirect Chains</h2>
                <p class="main-para">
                    If you are an SEO expert, you are continually looking to increase your website’s rankings. Google’s core algorithm is based on how websites link to each other. Link influence (PageRank) is passed when someone links to your site, but that influence has historically been diluted with redirect chains. By making your redirects as direct as possible, you are ensuring that your website is getting as much PageRank as possible. This, like many other SEO topics, is a controversial debate. Nevertheless, from a business risk perspective, the more redirects involved in the process of getting to your website, the more opportunities exists for that chain to become broken, thus losing all of the PageRank influence and traffic. If a search engine crawls a link that redirects and breaks due to an error, the page will eventually lose rankings or be delisted.
